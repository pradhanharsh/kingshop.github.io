1.1	What is it about?
By definition, ecommerce or electronic commerce, is the buying and selling of products or services via the Internet. For many Americans, ecommerce is something we participate in on a daily basis, like online bill payment or purchasing from an e-trailer.
Nowadays the thought of living without ecommerce seems unfathomable, complicated and an inconvenience to many. It wasn’t until only a few decades ago that the idea of ecommerce had even appeared.
Ecommerce was introduced 40 years ago and, to this day, continues to grow with new technologies, innovations, and thousands of businesses entering the online market each year. The convenience, safety, and user experience of ecommerce has improved exponentially since its inception in the 1970’s. This article will address some of the key players and milestones of ecommerce.

1.2	Purpose
E-commerce (electronic commerce or EC) is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet. These business transactions occur either as business-to-business, business-to-consumer, consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business. The terms e-commerce and e-business are often used interchangeably. The term e-tail is also sometimes used in reference to transactional processes for online shopping.
1.3	E-commerce and the Motivation to Start
Ecommerce is the hinge that allows the online business door to swing wide open. This is the industry of cyber business. It goes beyond simply saying, "Look at me world, I have an idea. Doesn't anyone care?" Ecommerce allows you to take your idea and connect it with consumers and your bank. It allows the free flow of commerce, your ideas, those who want to join you in what you are doing and a banking institution that can manage the electronic transfer of funds.
The overriding benefit of ecommerce is its low cost when compared to a brick and mortar storefront. However, an equally compelling benefit is the ability to appeal to a substantially larger consumer base.
Ecommerce can seem scary to those who have never dipped a toe into the waters of cyber sales. This can be likened to the apprehension some have felt over the use of a cell phone instead of a landline, a word processor instead a typewriter or a computer instead of an encyclopaedia. These are not necessarily Luddites, but they do possess a fear over the use of something they don't understand.

1.4	Concrete goals of E-commerce
At present, ecommerce is the most vast and popular business sector. Its an online buying and selling process so its needs are as simple as the business means. Customer reaching, High sales, Products quality and on time delivery are some of the needs of any E-commerce business. And when we talk about its objectives so basically its objectives are for fulfilling its needs. Objectives are:
High reach ability - The main objective and at the same time need is traction on your web store. Of course if you are selling products online what you require are customers. If you are getting good reach ability then your business will definitely grow. Therefore one of the objectives is high reach ability.
High Conversions- People are coming on your web store and purchasing something then it will calculate as conversions and from the number of people who are buying stuff from your web store we can calculate the conversion rate.
Customer Satisfaction- Customer is the main part of any E-commerce business so it’s very important to make your customer happy and satisfied. By providing quality and desirable products, on time delivery, 24*7 customer support, and timely sale & best deal offers you can make your customer happy. It is one of the main objectives of E-commerce.
Social popularity - Unless and until you are not famous and popular among people you cannot establish your brand. Social presence with Digital Marketing is essential for any E-commerce business.

3. TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THE PROJECT

3.1HTML

Type: A mark-up language, not a programming language.
HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) is what websites are made of. When you view the source of a webpage you are seeing html. It is structured as an xml document which means that it’s easy for a person to read and understand. If you are going to do anything on the internet then you need to at least gain a basic understanding of html. The best beginning place for this (and almost any web technology) is the W3 Schools website. While it doesn’t delve deeply into them this resource will start you off on the right path with all of the basic web technologies and it is made and maintained by the same group that develops the web standards so you can be sure the instruction is up to date and reflects good practices.

3.2CSS

Type: Not a programming language. Adds visual description to html.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) can be considered part of html; it can be used in an html document or written in its own file to be included to an html doc later. Css exists to give style, visual description of how things should look and be placed, to the elements of an html document. These properties used to be integrated into the writing of html code but they became separated as coders realized they were having to write repetitive code and make changes in too many places. Now pages of a whole website can be written with no styles and all include the same css file. This means changes to fonts, colors and backgrounds can be made in one place. This also has allowed web development to follow the concepts of MVC (Model View Controller) design which is outside the scope of this article but a very important part of designing good software and good interfaces.

3.3JAVASCRIPT

Type: Client side script language
JavaScript is the only language embedded in all web browsers. It allows a huge number of the “web 2.0″ features we’ve all become comfortable with such as animated menus, dynamic content, user behaviour tracking, context sensitive inserts (ads) and many many more things.
JavaScript is a client side programming language which means that after the page has loaded on a user’s (clients) device the JavaScript runs there, on their computer, as part of the web page. This can be confusing to a new web developer trying to make their server side language (such as php) talk to JavaScript or vice versa. The confusion is because the two languages never run at the same time. Then your JavaScript runs on that page. The two can communicate but it happens much differently and is covered at the end of this article.
Users can disable JavaScript but that has become so rare that it’s barely a concern anymore since you can scarcely navigate today’s internet without JavaScript turned on.
